                <p>In the first Sprint of CLE 1 we had to make a robot for one of our teammates based on aspects of their personality.
                    My partner was my class- and teammate Yaran de Jong. First i interviewed him as a way to get to know him better. Through this interview I took an interest in two specific aspects, those being his love for pizza and that he enjoys playing RPG games.
                    Using these two aspects I made a robot for him. This robot's name is: "Pizza buffer Delivery Buddy", a robot that delivers stat buffs to you in the form of pizza.
                </p>

                <h3 class = "how">How does it work?</h3>
      
                <p>The P.B.D.B. robot makes use of the Circuit Playground with the crickit attachment. I made use of 2 motors, the LED lights on the playground itself, the sound and light sensors, and sound.
                    When the Playground registers a loud sound, say a clap of your hands, the robot will proceed to move forward. After you take a slice of pizza, it will sense an increase in lightlevel and play a sound.

                    <h2>The Bird Bot</h2>
                    
                    <p>For Sprint 2 of CLE 1 we, as a team, in my case peerteam 26, had to choos one of our robots to flesh out. We decided to take my teammate Suhail's angrybird robot to expand on.
                        The image below shows how our new "Bird Bot" turned out at the end of the Sprint.
                        The Bird Bot was made as a solution to our teammate Carisia's problem, which is: she wantes some kind of entertainment for her birds at home. That entertainment needed to be both colorful and durable.
                        The Bird Bot is made out of wood, 6mm think, that was cut using the Laser Cutter at the Stadslab.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="how">How does it work?</h3>

                    <p>Using the same Circuit playground and Crickit combo, we made the Bird Box a fairly good entertainment tool for carisia'sbirds.
                        The yellow color was chosen instead of red so that the birds don't relentlessly attack the Bird Box when it's hung in their cage.
                        The Bird Box itself can play music and can dispense bird feed for the birds when played with.

                    <h2>The Bird Bot: Version 2</h2>

                    <p>In spint 3 me and my peergroup kept working on the Bird Bot to make it both bigger and better. We added some more features which I will explain further below.
                        It was tested at Carisia's house. In the image below you see the Bird Bot v2 alongside one of her birds, in this case Bobby.

                    <h3>What's new?</h3>

                    <p>We added some music to the Bird Bot as a way to help entertain the birds. Along with this, we made it so the hole at the bottom of the robot has a hatch of sorts.
                        To do this we made use of a servo that react to a button press that will open the latch and dispense bird seed for the birds to snack on.
